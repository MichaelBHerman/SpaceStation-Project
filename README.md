# SpaceStation-Project
In this project, I create an International Space Station tracker application to allow the user to see where the ISS is currently at over Earth and track it with real-time data.  I've also added a live feed so the user can get a HD view from the ISS itself! This project was created using the WTIA REST API provided at https://wheretheiss.at/w/developer, along with JavaScript and CSS.
